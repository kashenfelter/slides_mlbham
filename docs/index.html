Absolutely none of this should be considered investment advice.

These are my own views and opinions and are subject to change without notice.

Past performance does not indicate future results.

# Machine Learning (not called "ml") in Portfolio Management/Analytics

Just because it isn't usually called "machine learning", a lot of portfolio management, analytics, and optimization incorporates techniques now commonly used in machine learning.

Harry Markowitz's seminal 1952 paper [Portfolio Selection](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5160592821225000015&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,30&amp;as_vis=1) is matrix math.   See [An Open-Source Implementation of the Critical-Line Algorithm for Portfolio Optimization](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4fb1/2c1129ba5389bafe47b03e595d098d0252b9.pdf) and [repo](https://github.com/mdengler/cla).

## R Portfolio Packages

### [PortfolioAnalytics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PortfolioAnalytics/index.html)

### [fPortfolio](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fPortfolio/index.html)

&gt; We modify two popular methods in machine learning, regularization and cross-validation, for the portfolio optimization problem.
